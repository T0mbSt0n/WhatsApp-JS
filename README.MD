# WhatsApp Bot using whatsappweb-js

## How to Install

npm install
npm run start
```
**Enjoy**

## License

Use it at your own risk. WhatsApp could ban your number. If anything happen to your number or whatsapp account, I am not responsible for that.

## How to Use it
- Run the app using `npm run start`
- Open browser [localhost](http://localhost:3001)
- I know it is JS and should be use port **3000** but no, it use **3001** and if you ask why, you can get the heck out of here.
- Open your whatsApp in phone then scan the QR-Code
- It will redirect you to page Tracking logs for whats happening (message succesfully sent, failed, number not registered, etc)
- I think it's detail enough, even a monkey could do it.

## Use
This repo will be or will be not being public in future, but if it so, I want you guys to know that you can use it for your projects, works, etc. Feel free to use it.
